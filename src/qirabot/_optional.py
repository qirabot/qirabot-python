"""Lazy loading of optional backend dependencies.

Each device backend (browser/desktop/appium) ships as an ``[project.optional-
dependencies]`` extra. Rather than importing those modules eagerly — or letting a
missing one surface as a raw ``ModuleNotFoundError`` traceback — call :func:`require`
at the point of use. It returns the imported module on success, or raises a
:class:`~qirabot.exceptions.MissingDependencyError` whose message tells the user the
exact install command to run — a ``uv tool install`` when qirabot itself lives in a
uv tool environment (the one-line installer's default), otherwise
``python -m pip install "qirabot[<extra>]"``.
