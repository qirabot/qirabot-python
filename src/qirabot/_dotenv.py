"""Best-effort ``.env`` loader (standard library only).

A small helper so an automation *script* can keep settings like ``QIRA_API_KEY``
/ ``QIRA_BASE_URL`` in a project ``.env`` instead of exporting them by hand.
Following the ``python-dotenv`` convention, this is **never** run implicitly:
the SDK does not read ``.env`` on its own — the calling script opts in by calling
:func:`load_dotenv` (typically once, at the top). That keeps the library free of
hidden side effects on ``os.environ``.

    ``path`` defaults to ``$QIRA_DOTENV`` or ``./.env``. Returns ``True`` if a

    a malformed line is skipped — it never raises. Existing ``os.environ`` keys
    are preserved unless ``override`` is set, so a real exported variable always
    wins. Supports ``#`` comments, an optional ``export`` prefix, and surrounding
