"""Knowledge resolution for bot.ai(): turn the ``knowledge`` argument into text.

``knowledge`` accepts the knowledge text itself (``str``), a local file
(``pathlib.Path``, read as UTF-8), or a list mixing both. Resolution happens
entirely client-side — the server only ever receives the final text. Remote
sources are deliberately unsupported: fetch them yourself (e.g.
``requests.get(url).text``) so auth, timeouts, and failure handling stay in
your code, and a broken fetch raises instead of silently injecting garbage
(an unauthenticated intranet wiki typically answers 200 with a login page).
