"""Qirabot iOS automation template (direct WDA — built in, no Appium server).

Uses qirabot's built-in WDA client, which talks straight to WebDriverAgent
(WDA) over HTTP. Fewer moving parts than ios_appium.py (no `appium` server
process, no XCUITest driver) and zero extra Python dependencies.

Zero go-ios/tunnel dependency: every action (screenshot, tap, type, app
launch) goes through WDA's HTTP API, so iOS 17+ devices do NOT need
`sudo ios tunnel start` or a RemoteXPC tunnel daemon.

Prereqs (real device):
    1. WDA built/signed once via Xcode and currently running on the device.
       (Same as ios_appium.py — qirabot can't drive iOS without WDA.)
    2. WDA reachable at http://127.0.0.1:8100. The standard USB path is iproxy
       in a separate terminal:
           iproxy 8100 8100        # brew install libimobiledevice
       Verify it returns "ready":
           curl http://127.0.0.1:8100/status

Install:
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    python -m pip install qirabot       # the WDA client is built in
    echo 'QIRA_API_KEY=qk_...' > .env    # load_dotenv() reads this (also QIRA_BASE_URL)

When to pick this over ios_appium.py:
    - You already have WDA running on :8100 and don't want an Appium server.
    - Faster cold-start (no XCUITest driver attach), nothing extra to install.
    Pick ios_appium.py instead for simulator support, auto WDA build/sign, or
    first-party Appium ecosystem features.

# To embed a device video in the report, pass record=True together with
# record_mjpeg_url="http://127.0.0.1:9100" (WDA's MJPEG stream; USB real device
# also needs `iproxy 9100 9100`, and ffmpeg must be installed) — or switch to
# ios_appium.py, which uses Appium's session recording API.
