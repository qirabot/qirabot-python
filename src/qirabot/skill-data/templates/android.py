"""Qirabot Android automation template (direct adb — built in, no server).

Fill in APP and TASK, then run:
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    python -m pip install qirabot        # zero extra dependencies for Android
    echo 'QIRA_API_KEY=qk_...' > .env    # load_dotenv() reads this (also QIRA_BASE_URL)
    adb devices            # confirm a device/emulator is connected
    python android.py

Drives the *device* by natural language — no Template images, no selectors.
The only host requirement is the adb binary (Android platform-tools) on PATH.
The HTML report is written to ./qira_runs/<date>/<run>/report.html on close.
