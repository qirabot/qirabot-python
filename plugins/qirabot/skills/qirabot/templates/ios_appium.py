"""Qirabot iOS automation template (Appium XCUITest, reusing a running WDA).

Qirabot drives iOS purely by vision (screenshot + coordinates), so it never
needs Appium's element finding — only screenshots, taps, and key input, all of
which WebDriverAgent (WDA) already provides. The fastest, most reliable setup on
a real device is therefore: build/sign WDA ONCE, leave it running on :8100, and
let Appium reuse it (no xcodebuild per run). That's what this template does.

Prereqs (real device):
    1. WDA already running and reachable — verify it returns "ready":
           curl http://localhost:8100/status
       (On a fresh machine, build/sign WDA once via Xcode or
        `appium driver run xcuitest open-wda`, then keep it running. USB
        forwarding to :8100 is typically `iproxy 8100 8100` in another terminal.)
    2. Appium server up in another terminal:
           appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 4723
    3. Run THIS script with the interpreter preflight echoed (not a bare
       `python`):  python scripts/preflight.py ios

Install:
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    python -m pip install "qirabot[appium]"
    echo 'QIRA_API_KEY=qk_...' > .env    # load_dotenv() reads this (also QIRA_BASE_URL)

When to pick this over ios_airtest.py:
    - Simulators (Appium can build WDA itself — see Variant A below).
    - No pre-running WDA: let Appium build/sign on every run (Variant B).
    - You want Appium's first-party device APIs (screen recording, file
      transfer, deep XCUITest features).
    Pick ios_airtest.py instead if WDA is already on :8100 and you want the
    minimal-deps path (no `appium` server, no XCUITest driver).

The HTML report is written to ./qira_runs/<date>/<run>/report.html on close.

# device via Appium instead and write it to bot.report_dir/recording.mp4 — the
# report auto-embeds any recording.mp4 there. Stop BEFORE the `with` exits
