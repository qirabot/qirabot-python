# What it does — and nothing else:
#   1. Installs uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if missing. uv downloads a
#      Python on demand, so the machine needs no pre-installed Python.
#   2. `uv tool install "qirabot[browser]"` — an isolated environment; never
#      touches system Python or any existing virtualenv.
#   3. `qirabot install-browser` — one-time Chromium download for the browser
#      backend. (The Android / iOS / Windows-window backends need no extras.)
#
# Uninstall just as cleanly:  uv tool uninstall qirabot
