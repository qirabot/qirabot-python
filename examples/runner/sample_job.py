"""Sample job for the desktop runner.

Write and test this on your own machine, then POST it to the runner (see
trigger.sh, or `curl --data-binary @sample_job.py -H "X-Runner-Token: ..."
http://VM_HOST:8765/run`). It is a plain standalone Qirabot script — the
runner just does `python sample_job.py` inside the remote machine's logged-in
desktop session and streams stdout/stderr back to you live.

Printing the task_id lets you open the run in the web console without
watching the screen.
