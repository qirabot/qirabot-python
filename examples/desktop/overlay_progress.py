"""Progress overlay: an on-screen status window the bot's screenshots can't see.

A small always-on-top window in the bottom-right corner shows what the bot is
doing. It is excluded from screen capture (macOS NSWindowSharingNone, Windows
WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE) and click-through, so it neither appears in the bot's
own full-screen screenshots nor swallows a click aimed at the app below it.
macOS and Windows only; everywhere else it is a silent no-op.

Two ways to use it, shown below in one script:

1. `Qirabot(overlay=True)` — the bot drives the window: the instruction on
   ai() start, every step's action + reasoning, the final ✓/✗ outcome.
2. A standalone `Overlay` — your script drives the window, so phases that
   aren't bot steps (downloads, uploads, your own loops) show progress too;
   `ov.step` plugs the bot's steps in for just the AI part.

Install:
    python -m pip install "qirabot[desktop]"

Run:
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/desktop/overlay_progress.py
