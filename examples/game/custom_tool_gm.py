"""Custom tools: let the AI call your GM backend mid-task.

Registers a gm_command tool with bot.ai(). When the model hits a blocker it
can solve with a GM command (out of energy, missing items), it calls the tool;
the SDK runs your function locally — the server never sees your GM endpoint
or token — and feeds the return value back so the model continues the UI flow.

Run:
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/game/custom_tool_gm.py
