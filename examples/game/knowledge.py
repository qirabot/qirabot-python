"""knowledge=: give bot.ai() the game rules so it doesn't get stuck.

When the model doesn't know your game (what an item icon means, how a dungeon
flow works), it stalls or guesses. knowledge= supplies that background as
reference material in the system prompt — separate from the instruction, so a
rules document is never mistaken for the task itself. Pass the text, a local
file as pathlib.Path (UTF-8), or a list mixing both; for a remote source fetch
the text yourself (requests.get(url).text) and pass it.

Scope is per bot.ai() call, which makes staged loading natural: each stage
mounts only its own knowledge, and whatever the previous stage used is gone.

Hard rules are a different thing: "GM may only be used once" enforced in the
tool handler is a guarantee; written in knowledge it is only a suggestion.
Do both — the knowledge line saves the model a wasted attempt, the handler
guard makes violation impossible.

Run:
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/game/knowledge.py
