"""Drive a Windows desktop game with Qirabot — splash launch + AI UI audit.

Pattern:
  1. Launch the game executable via ShellExecuteW (matches a real double-click —
     follows UAC and shell hooks that subprocess.Popen would skip, which most
     launchers require).
  2. Bind with ``Window(class_name=..., timeout=...)`` — matching the renderer
     window by *class name* (Unity games expose ``UnityWndClass``; Unreal uses
     ``UnrealWindow``) rules out File Explorer windows whose title happens to
     share the game name, and ``timeout`` keeps polling while the game boots.
     Input goes out as DirectInput scancodes that game engines can read.
  3. Drive splash → in-game with deterministic ``wait_for`` / ``click`` /
     ``press_key`` steps (cheaper and steadier than AI for known UI), then
     hand the open-ended UI audit to ``bot.ai``.

Recording is built-in: ``record_window=True`` crops to the game window's
visible rect (GPU-composited windows safe — fullscreen capture would otherwise
go black on most games), and ``record_audio=True`` auto-detects a loopback
device.

Set ``QIRA_API_KEY`` and ``QIRA_GAME_EXE`` in a ``.env`` next to this script,
adjust the constants below for your game, and run elevated so input reaches
admin-protected game windows:
