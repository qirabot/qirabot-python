"""Windows window quickstart — bind to one window, game-readable input.

The built-in Windows backend (stdlib ctypes, zero extra installs) drives a
single window: screenshots are its client area, clicks are window-relative,
and keys go out as DirectInput scancodes — the input level games poll, which
virtual-key automation often can't reach.

For whole-desktop automation on any OS use the pyautogui backend instead
(`pip install "qirabot[desktop]"`, pass the pyautogui module as the target).

Install:
    python -m pip install qirabot

Run (Windows, with the target app open):
    set QIRA_API_KEY=qk_...
    python examples\\windows\\quickstart.py
