"""Android quickstart — direct over adb, zero Python dependencies.

The built-in adb backend needs nothing but the adb binary (Android
platform-tools) on PATH and a device with USB debugging enabled.

Install:
    python -m pip install qirabot

Run (connect a device/emulator first — check with `adb devices`):
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/adb/quickstart.py
