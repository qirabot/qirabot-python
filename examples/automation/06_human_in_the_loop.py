"""Human-in-the-loop: pause bot.ai() for CAPTCHAs and login walls via a custom tool.

Registers a request_human_help tool with bot.ai(). When the model hits a
verification automation can't pass — a sign-in challenge, CAPTCHA, or 2FA
prompt — it calls the tool; the SDK runs it locally, which blocks on input()
until you finish the verification in the (headed) browser window, then the
model re-checks the page and continues the task.

A persistent profile (user_data_dir) makes the pause a one-time cost: the
session cookie survives, so the next run sails through without help. To skip
even the first pause, log in ahead of time with no AI task at all:
`qirabot open-browser --user-data-dir ~/.qirabot-profile` — this example is
for walls the model hits mid-task.

Install:
    python -m pip install "qirabot[browser]"
    playwright install chromium

Run:
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/automation/06_human_in_the_loop.py
