"""Standalone automation: run several browsers in parallel (process pool).

Each Qirabot drives one browser, so to work on N pages at once you run N
processes. The catch is the profile: a single on-disk profile can't be opened by
two Chrome instances at the same time. The fix is to keep one **logged-in master
profile** and hand each worker its own throwaway copy — every worker inherits the
login state but they never fight over the same directory.

Use threads instead of processes only if your work is I/O-bound and you don't
need separate profiles; for real browser fan-out, processes are the safe default.

Install:
    pip install "qirabot[browser]"
    playwright install chromium

Run:
    export QIRA_API_KEY="qk_..."
    python examples/automation/05_concurrent.py
