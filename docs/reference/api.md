# API Reference

## Simple actions (AI-located)

Lightweight vision-based element location — fast and low-cost:

```python
# Click on an element by description
bot.click(page, "Login button")

# Auto-wait: poll until the element looks present (up to timeout) before
# clicking, else raise QirabotTimeoutError. Works on every framework.
# `wait` overrides the auto-derived assertion. (Also on type_text/double_click.)
bot.click(page, "Login button", timeout=15.0, interval=2.0)

# Modifier-click: hold modifier key(s) around the click (desktop only)
bot.click(target, "enemy unit", modifier="alt")       # alt+click (games)
bot.click(target, "file row", modifier="ctrl+shift")  # join several with "+"

# Type text into an input field
bot.type_text(page, "Email input", "user@example.com")

# Extract data from the screen
text = bot.extract(page, "Get the main heading")

# Verify a visual assertion — a failed check doesn't raise, it returns a
# falsy VerifyResult (with a .reason); truthy when the check passes
ok = bot.verify(page, "The success message is visible")

# Wait for a condition (acts as a gate): returns when met, else raises
# QirabotTimeoutError. Use verify() for a non-raising bool check.
bot.wait_for(page, "Page has finished loading", timeout=15.0, interval=2.0)
```

`click`, `type_text`, and `double_click` return the current target (the same
kind you passed in). When an action opens a link in a **new tab**, the return
value is that new tab — reassign it to keep operating on the active page:

```python
page = bot.click(page, "Open the first video")  # may switch to a new tab
```

## Multi-step AI — bot.ai()

```python
result = bot.ai(page, "Search for SpaceX and summarize the first result", max_steps=10)
print(result.success, result.status, result.output)
```

## Navigation, scrolling & keys (no AI, no billing)

Direct actions that don't need AI element location. `go_back`, `navigate`,
`close_tab`, and `press_key` return the current page/target (may differ after
the action); `scroll` returns `None`.

```python
bot.navigate(page, "example.com")   # scheme optional; "https://" prepended
bot.go_back(page)                   # back to the previous page (smart, see below)
page = bot.close_tab(page)          # close current tab, return to previous tab
bot.scroll(page, "down", 3)         # scroll at viewport center
bot.scroll(page, "up", distance=5, x=640, y=400)  # scroll at a point
bot.press_key(page, "Enter")        # a single key
bot.press_key(page, "ctrl+c")       # a combo (join with "+")
bot.press_key(target, "w", duration_seconds=2)  # hold for 2s (desktop only)
page = bot.press_key(page, "ctrl+w")  # closes the tab, switches to another — reassign
bot.type_text(page, "", "hello", press_enter=True)  # empty locate: type into the
                                    # focused element directly (no AI, no billing)
```

**Direct typing.** `type_text` with an **empty `locate`** skips AI location
and types into whatever currently has keyboard focus — for when focus is
already where you want it (a game chat box opened with Enter, a field reached
via Tab). Making sure focus is right is your responsibility; `press_enter` /
`clear_before_typing` still work, `timeout`/`wait` are ignored.

**`press_key` — what you can pass.** One name works on every backend; each
maps it to its own vocabulary:

| Category | Examples | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single keys | `Enter` `Escape` `Tab` `Backspace` `Delete` `Space` | |
| Arrows / paging | `ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right` `PageUp` `PageDown` `Home` `End` | |
| Combos (desktop/browser) | `ctrl+c` `ctrl+a` `alt+tab` `ctrl+shift+t` | modifiers `ctrl` `alt` `shift` `cmd` (= meta/win); join with `+` |
| Mobile (Android/iOS) | `Back` `Home` `Menu` `Enter` | single keys only, no combos. `Back`/`Menu` are Android-only; iOS (WDA) supports `Home`, `Enter`, volume and lock keys and raises `NotImplementedError` for the rest |
| Hold (desktop) | `duration_seconds=2` (float > 0, capped at 10) | holds the key(s) that long before releasing — quantified in-game movement (`w`, `shift+w`). pyautogui + Windows window backend only; web/mobile ignore it and tap |

So `bot.press_key(t, "Enter")` becomes an adb keycode on Android and a
DirectInput scancode on the Windows window backend automatically.

**Smart `go_back` (Playwright):** if the current page has back history it
goes back in place; if it doesn't — e.g. a click opened a link in a **new
tab**, which starts with no history — and another tab is open, it closes the
current tab and returns to the previous one:

```python
for i in range(4):
    page = bot.click(page, f"open video {i + 1}")  # opens a new tab
    bot.screenshot(page)
    page = bot.go_back(page)                       # closes it, back to the list
```

Reach for `close_tab` to force-close the current tab regardless of history.

AI-located actions (`click`, `type_text`, `double_click`) and the AI
operations (`extract`, `verify`, `wait_for`, `ai`) work on **every**
framework — the matrix shows how each underlying action maps per platform.

- ᵃ Touch platforms emulate `double_click` as two quick taps.
- ᵇ Mobile has no right-click: it degrades to a tap.
- ᶜ Touch targets have no hover: it's a no-op on mobile.
- ᵈ No element model over raw adb/WDA; `clear_text` is best-effort (caret-to-end + repeated delete on Android, backspace burst on iOS).
- ᵉ The Windows window backend sends DirectInput scancodes (real hardware-level keys, incl. `ctrl`/`alt`/`win` combos); characters outside the scancode table are injected as unicode key events. `duration_seconds` (hold) works on pyautogui + the Windows window backend only; elsewhere it degrades to an instant tap.
- ᶠ `long_press` is a touch-only gesture (Android/iOS). Browser/desktop adapters raise `NotImplementedError`.
- ᵍ `mouse_down`/`mouse_up`/`key_down`/`key_up` are desktop-only split press/release primitives (pyautogui + the Windows window backend) for holding an input across other actions. Pair each press with its release; any input still held is auto-released at the end of an `ai()` run and on `close()`. `mouse_up`'s locate is optional (omit to release at the current cursor — deterministic, no AI, no billing). Browser/mobile adapters raise `NotImplementedError`.
- ʰ iOS has no back button; `go_back` performs the universal left-edge swipe gesture.

`navigate`/`go_back` raise `NotImplementedError` where unsupported;
`close_tab` is Playwright-only, so the new-tab fallback inside `go_back`
applies to Playwright only — on Selenium/Appium `go_back` is always
history-back, and on Android it maps to `keyevent BACK`.

## Screenshot (no AI)

Saves to `report_dir/screenshots/` and returns the saved path (or `None`
when `report=False`):

```python
path = bot.screenshot(page)
```

## Launch a desktop app (no AI)

pyautogui can drive the mouse and keyboard but cannot open an application.
`launch_app` shells out to the OS so desktop runs start from a known app:

```python
bot.launch_app("WeChat")             # macOS app name (or bundle id)
# launch_app("notepad")              # Windows: exe path, registered name, or UWP AppUserModelID
# launch_app("/path/to/app", wait=3) # wait seconds for the window to appear (default 2)
```

On macOS it uses `open -a`/`open -b` (activating an already-running app), on
Windows `os.startfile`/`start`/`explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder`, on Linux the
executable directly. Also available standalone:
`from qirabot import launch_app`.

## Task lifecycle

Each `Qirabot` instance manages a server-side task that tracks all
operations: created on construction (pass an existing `task_id` to attach
instead), every `click()` / `extract()` / `ai()` recorded as a step, marked
complete on `close()` or context-manager exit:

```python
with Qirabot(task_name="my automation") as bot:
    page = bot.open("https://example.com")
    print(bot.extract(page, "Get the main heading"))
# bot.close() is called automatically
```

If `close()` is never called, `atexit` cleans up on script exit. While the
process is alive, a background **heartbeat** keeps the server task marked
live (so sleeping between steps is safe); once the process dies silently,
the server's orphan cleaner times the task out after ~5 minutes.

Two more lifecycle calls when you need a terminal status other than
"completed": `bot.fail("what went wrong")` reports the task as failed, and
`bot.cancel("why")` reports it as cancelled — both before/instead of the
success-complete that `close()` records by default.
