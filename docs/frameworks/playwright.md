title: Add AI to Playwright Tests — Vision Assertions & Self-Healing Steps
description: Inject AI vision into an existing Playwright suite - natural-language locators, visual assertions with bot.verify(), data extraction, and autonomous bot.ai() steps alongside your selectors.

# Playwright + Qirabot

Keep your Playwright suite exactly as it is — selectors, fixtures, CI — and
add AI where selectors hurt: dynamic content, canvas, third-party widgets,
and assertions about *what the page looks like* rather than what the DOM
contains.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from qirabot import Qirabot

bot = Qirabot()

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://github.com/trending")

    # Your selectors and AI steps interleave freely
    repos = bot.extract(page, "Get the top 5 trending repo names")
    print(repos)

    browser.close()
bot.close()
```

No configuration: every Qirabot action takes the Playwright `page` as its
first argument.

## What each call family gives you

- **`bot.verify(page, "the cart shows 1 item")`** — replaces
  element-exists assertions with a visual one. Survives markup rewrites,
  copy tweaks, and CSS refactors.
- **`bot.extract(page, "the prices in the results list as a JSON array")`**
  — structured data straight off the rendered page, no parsing logic.
- **`bot.click(page, "the Login button")`** — natural-language locator when
  a stable selector doesn't exist.
- **`bot.ai(page, "complete checkout as John Doe, zip 10001")`** — hand a
  whole flaky flow to the AI, assert on `result.success`.

## New tabs: reassign the returned page

A click can open a new tab; `click` / `type_text` / `press_key` return the
page your next native call should use. Keep the explicit form with
Playwright (rather than `bind()`), so tab switches stay visible:

```python
page = bot.click(page, "Open the first video")   # may return a new tab
page.fill("#comment", "nice")                    # native call on the right page

for i in range(4):
    page = bot.click(page, f"open video {i + 1}")
    bot.screenshot(page)
    page = bot.go_back(page)   # smart: closes the history-less new tab, back to the list
```

Closing a tab with `bot.press_key(page, "ctrl+w")` switches the active tab
too — same rule, reassign. If you do use a bound bot, the live page is
available as `bot.current_page()`.

## Auto-wait

AI-located actions poll until the element looks present, then act:

```python
bot.click(page, "Login button", timeout=15.0, interval=2.0)
bot.wait_for(page, "the dashboard has finished loading", timeout=15.0)
```

Playwright's own auto-waiting continues to apply to your native calls;
Qirabot adds no settle delay on Playwright (it trusts the framework).

## Under the hood

Screenshots go to the Qirabot server for reasoning and element location;
actions execute locally through your Playwright session. Your code, cookies,
and credentials never leave the machine — only screenshots are uploaded.
