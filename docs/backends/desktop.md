title: Desktop Automation with AI Vision (pyautogui)
description: Automate any desktop app on macOS, Windows, or Linux with AI vision on top of pyautogui — launch apps, click by description, hold keys, and record the screen.

# Desktop (pyautogui)

The desktop backend drives the **whole screen** on macOS, Windows, or Linux
through pyautogui — with AI vision replacing pixel-hunting and template
images. Describe the element; the AI finds it on the screenshot and the click
lands there.

Requires the `desktop` extra: `pip install "qirabot[desktop]"`.

```python
import pyautogui
from qirabot import Qirabot

bot = Qirabot(task_name="wechat")

bot.launch_app("WeChat")              # macOS app name (or bundle id)
bot.ai(pyautogui, "Send 'hello' to honey in WeChat")
bot.close()
```

The target here is the **`pyautogui` module itself** — on the desktop there is
no page or driver object, so passing the module is how you say "drive the
whole screen". (Every call takes a target this way; see
[Custom Adapters & Bolt-On](/backends/custom-adapters) for the full list of
accepted target types, and `bind()` to stop repeating it.)

From the CLI:

```bash
qirabot desktop "Create a new note titled Groceries" --app Notes
```

## Launching apps

pyautogui can move the mouse but cannot open an application. `launch_app`
shells out to the OS so runs start from a known app:

```python
bot.launch_app("WeChat")             # macOS: app name or bundle id
# launch_app("notepad")              # Windows: exe path, registered name, or UWP AppUserModelID
# launch_app("/path/to/app", wait=3) # wait for the window to appear (default 2s)
```

Per-OS launch mechanics are in the
[API reference](/reference/api#launch-a-desktop-app-no-ai).

## Desktop-only input primitives

The desktop backends (pyautogui and the
[Windows window backend](/backends/windows-games)) support input shapes the
web/mobile targets don't:

```python
bot.press_key(pyautogui, "w", duration_seconds=2)     # hold a key
bot.click(pyautogui, "file row", modifier="ctrl+shift")  # modifier-click
bot.key_down(pyautogui, "shift")                      # split press/release
bot.mouse_down(pyautogui, "the slider handle")        # press-and-hold drags
bot.mouse_up(pyautogui)                               # release at current cursor
```

Held inputs are auto-released at the end of an `ai()` run and on `close()`.
Exact semantics of each primitive are in the
[platform support matrix](/reference/api#platform-support-matrix).

## Screen recording

`Qirabot(record=True)` records the full screen with ffmpeg for the whole run
and embeds `recording.mp4` in the HTML report. macOS: grant the terminal/IDE
"Screen Recording" permission, and pick a monitor with `QIRA_SCREEN_INDEX` if
you have several. Recording is best-effort — a missing ffmpeg only warns,
never fails the task.

## When to use which desktop backend

| | pyautogui backend | [Window backend](/backends/windows-games) |
|---|---|---|
| OS | macOS / Windows / Linux | Windows only |
| Scope | whole screen | one window (title regex / HWND) |
| Input level | virtual keys | DirectInput scancodes (game-readable) |
| Install | `qirabot[desktop]` | built in |

Rule of thumb: automating a game or wanting window isolation on Windows →
Window backend; anything else on the desktop → pyautogui.
