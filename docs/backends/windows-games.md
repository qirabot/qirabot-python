title: Automate Windows Apps & Games with AI — DirectInput Scancodes
description: Bind one Windows window by title or HWND and drive it with AI vision. Input is DirectInput scancodes that Unity, Unreal, and native games actually read — where virtual-key automation fails.

# Windows & Games — the Window backend

`qirabot.Window` binds to a **single window** (by title regex or HWND):
screenshots are its client area, clicks are window-relative, and keys are
**DirectInput scancodes** — the level games poll, which virtual-key
automation (pyautogui, AutoHotkey's default send mode) can't reach. Stdlib
ctypes only; built into the core package, no extras.

Combined with AI vision for element location, this drives what no
DOM/accessibility-based framework can: Unity and Unreal games, custom
launchers, legacy native apps.

The quickest check is the CLI — built in, no extras:

```bash
qirabot desktop "Open the inventory and list all items" --window-title "Genshin"
qirabot desktop "..." --hwnd 132456
```

The same thing in Python:

```python
from qirabot import Qirabot, Window

window = Window(title="Genshin")   # literal substring; or Window(hwnd=132456)
bot = Qirabot().bind(window)

result = bot.ai("Open the inventory and list all items")
bot.close()
```

`Window` selectors: `hwnd=` (explicit handle), `title=` (literal substring —
paste the title straight from the taskbar, parentheses and dots are safe),
`title_re=` (a regex, for fuzzy/multi-language matching), or `class_name=`
(exact window class — Unity games expose `UnityWndClass`, Unreal
`UnrealWindow`; steadier than titles and combinable with `title`/`title_re`).
If several windows match, resolution fails listing the candidates; when the
duplicates are unavoidable — cloud-gaming clients and launcher overlays often
share the main window's exact title — add `ambiguous="largest"` (CLI:
`--ambiguous largest`) to pick the biggest window. The console window running
qirabot is never a candidate: its title echoes the command line, pattern
included, and would otherwise match itself. `timeout=` keeps polling for the
window while a game is still starting:

```python
window = Window(title="MyGame · Cloud(Beta)", ambiguous="largest")
window = Window(class_name="UnityWndClass", timeout=180)   # just-launched game
```

Before each typing/keypress call, the backend switches the focused control's
input language to US English and closes its IME — an active CJK IME would
swallow injected letter keys into its composition window instead of the game.
The switch is re-asserted every time (IME state belongs to the focused
control and comes back whenever a text box takes focus), and it is verified:
a window that refuses to give up its IME gets text via clipboard paste, which
bypasses IME composition entirely. Typing CJK text never needs a CJK IME —
non-ASCII strings always travel the paste path, so forcing English input
loses nothing. Only the target window is touched (Win+Space switches it
back); pass `Window(..., english_ime=False)` to leave the IME alone.

## Game-grade input

- **Keys are scancodes** — real hardware-level input, including
  `ctrl`/`alt`/`win` combos. Characters outside the scancode table are
  injected as unicode key events.
- **Hold a key for a duration** — quantified in-game movement:

  ```python
  bot.press_key(window, "w", duration_seconds=2)      # walk forward 2s
  bot.press_key(window, "shift+w", duration_seconds=1.5)  # sprint
  ```

- **Modifier-click** — atomic alt+click for games, ctrl+click multi-select:

  ```python
  bot.click(window, "enemy unit", modifier="alt")
  ```

- **Split press/release primitives** — `mouse_down` / `mouse_up` /
  `key_down` / `key_up` hold an input across other actions (keep moving while
  clicking, press-and-hold drags). Any input still held is auto-released at
  the end of an `ai()` run and on `close()`.

## Mixing deterministic steps with AI

Game UI audits work well as deterministic navigation plus AI verification:

```python
bot.click(window, "the Bag icon")
bot.wait_for(window, "the inventory panel is open")
ok = bot.verify(window, "every item slot shows an icon and a count")
items = bot.extract(window, "list the item names visible in the inventory")
```

See the full walkthrough in
[examples/game/](https://github.com/qirabot/qirabot-python/tree/main/examples/game),
including a custom-tool example where the AI calls your GM backend mid-task
(add energy on an out-of-energy popup, then continue the daily-quest loop) —
how to register such tools is in
[AI Tasks & Custom Tools](/advanced/ai-tasks).

## Recording the window

On Windows you can record just the window under test, with system audio:

```python
bot = Qirabot(record=True, record_window=True, record_audio=True)
```

Keep the window visible — `gdigrab` produces black frames for minimized or
GPU-composited (fullscreen-exclusive game) windows; for those, record the
full screen instead.

## Notes

- Whole-desktop automation (any OS) is the separate
  [pyautogui backend](/backends/desktop); the Window backend is
  Windows-specific and single-window by design.
- Coming from Airtest 1.x? `connect_device("Windows:///132456")` becomes
  `Window(hwnd=132456)`.
