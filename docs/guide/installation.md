description: Install the Qirabot Python SDK and CLI — one-line installer, uv, or pip. Includes per-backend extras for browser, desktop, and Appium, plus troubleshooting.

# Installation

One line — installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), qirabot (isolated, never
touches your system Python), and Chromium. No pre-installed Python required:

::: code-group

```bash [macOS / Linux]
curl -LsSf https://qirabot.com/install | sh
```

```powershell [Windows]
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://qirabot.com/install.ps1 | iex"
```

:::

Already have uv? The same result by hand:

```bash
uv tool install "qirabot[browser]" && qirabot install-browser
```

**Driving a device instead of a browser?** The Android (adb), iOS (WDA), and
Windows single-window backends are built into the core package — the install
is just:

```bash
uv tool install qirabot        # Android + iOS + Windows window; zero extras
```

## pip / virtualenv

Requires Python 3.10+. Use a virtualenv — Debian/Ubuntu block system-Python
installs per PEP 668:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install "qirabot[browser]"
qirabot install-browser          # or: playwright install chromium
```

**As a library** (importing `qirabot` in your own tests): install into your
project's environment instead of a tool environment —
`uv pip install "qirabot[browser]"` or the pip lines above.

## Extras per backend

The core package attaches to the Playwright / Selenium / Appium / pyautogui
session you already run. Frameworks stay in extras — install the one matching
yours, or nothing if it's already in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install "qirabot[browser]"   # Playwright (managed browser)
python -m pip install "qirabot[desktop]"   # pyautogui (whole-desktop, any OS)
python -m pip install "qirabot[appium]"    # Appium (Android / iOS via a server; device clouds)
python -m pip install "qirabot[all]"       # everything above

python -m pip install qirabot selenium     # Selenium is not an extra — bring your own driver
```

All extras install cleanly together in one environment — since 2.0 nothing
pins numpy/opencv.

## Verify your environment

```bash
qirabot doctor
```

`doctor` reports what is installed, what is missing (with the exact command to
fix it), and whether your API key reaches the server. Haven't saved a key yet?
That check will flag it — the [Quick Start](/guide/quickstart)'s first command
(`qirabot login`) is the fix.

## Troubleshooting

- The one-line installer is also served directly from the GitHub repo:
  `curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qirabot/qirabot-python/main/scripts/install.sh | sh`
- `error: externally-managed-environment` — you're installing into the system
  Python (PEP 668); use the uv path above, or create/activate a virtualenv.
- Fresh **Linux** box: run `sudo playwright install-deps chromium` once — the
  Chromium download doesn't include the system libraries it links against
  (`error while loading shared libraries: libnspr4.so ...`).
- **Display-less** box (headless server / VM, no `DISPLAY`): a visible browser
  window can't open — `bot.open()` and the CLI detect that and automatically
  run headless, with a warning.

## Next steps

- [Quick Start](/guide/quickstart) — save your API key and run your first task
- [CLI Reference](/guide/cli) — run natural-language tasks without writing code
