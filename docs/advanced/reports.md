# Reports & Recording

## HTML run reports

By default every run writes a self-contained HTML report (with per-step
screenshots) when the bot closes — **including on error or Ctrl+C**, so you
can see where it stopped. No model calls, no network; it's built from data
captured during the run.

```python
bot = Qirabot(task_name="checkout")            # default: ./qira_runs/<date>/<time-id>/
bot = Qirabot(report_dir="./artifacts")        # custom root (or QIRA_REPORT_DIR)
bot = Qirabot(report=False)                    # off entirely — CI / library use
```

Output layout per run:

```
qira_runs/2026-06-07/192335-3f9ab2c1/
  report.html          # self-contained: embedded thumbnails + outcome badge per ai() task
  screenshots/         # full-resolution frames (001_click.jpg, 002_type_text.jpg, ...)
  recording.mp4        # if recording was on — embedded in the report
```

Each `ai()` task gets an outcome badge matching `result.status`: green
`PASS`, red `FAIL` / `ERROR`, amber `MAX STEPS` for step-budget truncations.
`screenshot_annotate=True` (default) draws a red crosshair at the resolved
click/type coordinates. `bot.report("path.html")` writes an extra copy on
demand; `bot.screenshot(target)` grabs a one-off frame.

## Host screen recording

```python
bot = Qirabot(record=True)          # or QIRA_RECORD=1
page = bot.open("https://example.com")
bot.ai(page, "do the thing")
bot.close()                         # stops recording, then writes the report
```

Or control it manually:

```python
bot.start_recording()               # idempotent; fps via record_fps
try:
    bot.ai(page, "do the thing")
finally:
    bot.stop_recording()            # one recording per run — restart overwrites
```

Needs the `ffmpeg` binary on PATH. macOS: grant "Screen Recording"
permission (or you get black frames), and pick a monitor with
`QIRA_SCREEN_INDEX` if you have several. Recording is best-effort: a missing
ffmpeg or denied permission warns and never fails the task (check
`recording.ffmpeg.log` in the run dir).

## Device screen recording (Android / iOS)

The default recorder captures the *host* screen — a phone doesn't appear on
it. Two switches record the device's own screen (both used by the CLI's
`android` / `ios --record`):

```python
# Android (or any Appium driver): recorder resolved from the action target
bot = Qirabot(record_device=True)   # AdbDevice -> adb screenrecord; Appium -> session API
bot.ai(dev, "open settings")
bot.close()                         # pulls the video into report_dir/recording.mp4

# iOS via WDA (no Appium): record WDA's MJPEG stream (port 9100;
# USB real device: `iproxy 9100 9100`). Needs ffmpeg on the host.
bot = Qirabot(record_mjpeg_url="http://127.0.0.1:9100")
```

`adb screenrecord` segments beyond its 3-minute cap are merged with ffmpeg.
If you quit an Appium driver yourself, call `bot.stop_recording()` first —
the video lives in the session.

The CLI's `--record` flag maps onto these switches per target — see the
[CLI Reference](/guide/cli). Every `record*` constructor knob and its env
var is listed in [Configuration](/advanced/configuration).

## Windows: per-window capture + system audio

```python
from qirabot import Qirabot, Window

window = Window(title_re="Notepad.*")
bot = Qirabot(record=True, record_window=True, record_audio=True)
bot.ai(window, "type a note")
bot.close()                         # recording.mp4 = just that window, with sound
```

- `record_window=True` records only the window under test (Windows window
  backend; falls back to full screen otherwise). Keep the window visible —
  `gdigrab` produces black frames for minimized or GPU-composited (game)
  windows; for games, record full screen.
- `record_audio=True` captures system audio via a DirectShow loopback device
  — install
  [screen-capture-recorder](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free)
  or enable "Stereo Mix". Auto-detected; override with a device name or
  `QIRA_AUDIO_DEVICE`; sync-nudge with `record_audio_offset=-0.4`.
