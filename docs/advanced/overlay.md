title: Progress Overlay & ESC Kill Switch
description: The always-on-top progress window, the amber edge glow that marks real mouse/keyboard takeover, and the hold-ESC kill switch - capture-excluded, click-through, and safe to leave on everywhere.

# Progress Overlay & Kill Switch

Every CLI task command shows a small always-on-top window in the screen's
bottom-right corner: the running instruction, each step's action and
reasoning, and the final ✓/✗ outcome. Turn it off with `--no-overlay`; in the
SDK it's `Qirabot(overlay=True)` (off by default).

The window is built so it can never interfere with the run:

- **Excluded from screen capture** — macOS `NSWindowSharingNone`, Windows
  `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` — so it never appears in the bot's own
  screenshots and never confuses the model.
- **Click-through**, so it never intercepts a click meant for the app below.
- Every failure is a silent no-op: on platforms without GUI support
  (Linux, CI, missing display) the overlay simply does nothing.

## Edge glow: the "hands off" signal

When a task drives the machine's **real mouse and keyboard** (the desktop
backends: `Window`, pyautogui), a slow-breathing amber glow lines the screen
edges for the duration of the run — the same visual language as a
screen-sharing border: *machine is being controlled, hands off*.
Remote-protocol targets (browser, Android, iOS) don't light it — your mouse
stays yours there.

The glow is capture-excluded like the window, with one stricter rule: on
Windows versions where exclusion isn't available it never shows at all —
glowing bars in every screenshot would blind the bot.

It isn't just `bot.ai()`: single-step calls (`bot.click`, `bot.press_key`,
`bot.type_text`, …) on desktop backends inject real input too, so they light
the glow as well. It comes on with the first call and fades a few seconds
after the last, so a scripted burst reads as one controlled stretch rather
than a flicker.

## Hold ESC to abort

While the glow is on, a small pill at the top of the screen reads
"Hold ESC to stop · 长按 ESC 中止". **Hold ESC for about a second** to abort
the run:

- The bot stops at the next step boundary. A step may take a few seconds to
  finish — an in-flight model call has to return — but no further input is
  injected while it does.
- Every key and mouse button the bot was holding is released.
- `bot.ai()` raises a `user_abort` error, and the task is recorded as
  **cancelled**, not failed — deliberate aborts stay out of your failure
  metrics.

Short ESC taps — yours or the bot's own — never trigger it.

The abort is **sticky**: every later `bot.ai()` on the same client raises
`user_abort` immediately (no glow, no input), so a `try/except` around one
run can't re-take the machine you just reclaimed. Continuing requires an
explicit `bot.clear_user_abort()`. Single-step calls stay available for
cleanup.

The kill switch rides the overlay: `--no-overlay` (or `overlay=False`) turns
it off too. On the pyautogui backend there is a fallback that needs no
overlay at all — slam the mouse into any screen corner and leave it there
(pyautogui's built-in failsafe).

On macOS the ESC listener needs the Accessibility permission — the same one
desktop control already requires. Without it, the listener silently degrades
and the corner failsafe remains.

## SDK: automatic window

One flag covers the common case — the bot runs the window for you: the
instruction as the headline with a running-state dot and elapsed clock, each
step as `step 3/20 · click · "…"` plus the model's reasoning, and the final
✓/✗ outcome.

```python
bot = Qirabot(overlay=True)   # every bot.ai() run reports to the window
```

## SDK: standalone `Overlay`

When your script is more than one `bot.ai()` call, hold the window yourself:
a standalone `Overlay` displays whatever you tell it, whenever — your own
phases included — and `ov.step` feeds it bot steps for just the AI part:

```python
from qirabot import Overlay

with Overlay() as ov:
    ov.begin("phase 1/3: downloading data…")
    data = download_from_api()                    # your own code, no bot

    ov.begin("phase 2/3: filling in the report system…",
             edge_glow=True)                      # real mouse/keyboard ahead
    bot.ai(pyautogui, "Import the data into the report system",
           on_step=ov.step)                       # bot steps go to the window

    ov.begin("phase 3/3: sending the summary mail…")
    send_email(data)
```

Already have an `on_step` callback of your own? `on_step=ov.wrap(my_cb)`
chains both.

## Platform notes & known limits

- **macOS**: support installs automatically with qirabot (pyobjc).
- **Windows**: uses the standard library's tkinter. Full capture exclusion
  needs Windows 10 2004+; older versions show a black box in captures
  instead of the window content (the edge glow, per the stricter rule above,
  simply doesn't show there).
- **Everywhere else** (Linux, CI, missing GUI): the overlay is a silent
  no-op — it can never break a run.
- **Exclusive-fullscreen games** bypass the desktop compositor, so no
  topmost window — overlay or glow — is visible above them. The run itself
  is unaffected; use borderless/windowed mode to see the overlay.
- After an ESC abort, a residual delay before the bot fully stops is the
  in-flight model call finishing — no input is injected during it.
